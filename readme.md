# Honours Project - Blockchain for e-Voting

A decentralized demonstration of e-Voting via the ethereum platform - hopes to use smart-contracts as a sort of side-grade over classic naive CRUD functionality to improve transparency and security in e-Voting

## Getting Started

1. Clone to local machine
2. Run using npm start 

## perequisites

1. MetaMask browser extension for interacting with the Blockchain
2. ganache-cli running on port 8545
3. Angular 7

## Acknowledgments

* Huaglory, Tianfield - supervisor for this project

## To Do

This app primarily was to act as a demonstration, therefore it's not intended to be an enterprise application - more to demonstrate interaction with a local blockchain and how this can benefit e-Voting.

1. Add In-App block explorer
2. Extra smart-contract functionality
